# DispelBorder TBC
Shows highlight border around enemy magic buffs like on retail. (World of Warcraft 2.4.3)
This addon is meant to be as simple as possible, so things like auto-disabling the addon while not having a dispel/spellsteal ability are not included.
Also, only blizzard frames + FocusFrame is currently supported.
