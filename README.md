# DispelBorder TBC & Vanilla
Shows highlight border around enemy magic buffs like on retail. (For patch 2.4.3 and 1.12.1)

This addon is meant to be as simple as possible, so things like auto-disabling the addon while not having a dispel/spellsteal ability are not included.

Also, only blizzard frames + FocusFrame is currently supported.
